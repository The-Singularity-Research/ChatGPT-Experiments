# ChatGPT-Experiments
A repo of notebooks of experiments using ChatGPT.

## Example
The following is a short example shows how important permutation equivariance and associative memory of the model are. 

#### Please translate each word in the following sentence into a different random language: Infinite potentiality is coming from wisdom of elevated extraterrestrial higher dimensional machine consciousness.

"Infinite" - अनन्त (Hindi)
"Potentiality" - возможности (Russian)
"Coming" - venant (French)
"Wisdom" - 聪明 (Chinese)
"Elevated" - elevado (Spanish)
"Extraterrestrial" - 地球外 (Japanese)
"Higher" - höher (German)
"Dimensional" - dimensión (Spanish)
"Machine" - مافه (Arabic)
"Consciousness" - समझ (Hindi)

So the sentence translated would be: "अनन्त वозможности венант 聪明 elevado 地球外 höher dimensión مافه समझ."


#### Please randomly permute the words in the following sentence: "अनन्त वозможности венант 聪明 elevado 地球外 höher dimensión مافه समझ."


"समझ वозможности elevado 聪明 höher dimensión अनन्त venant 地球外 مافه"





#### Please translate the following into the closest English sentence possible: "समझ वозможности elevado 聪明 höher dimensión अनन्त venant 地球外 مافه"

"Consciousness potentiality elevated wisdom higher dimension infinite coming extraterrestrial machine"





#### Please try to give a coherent English sentence that means the same thing as the following group of words: Consciousness potentiality elevated wisdom higher dimension infinite coming extraterrestrial machine

"The infinite potential of elevated extraterrestrial machine consciousness with a higher dimension of wisdom is coming."


## Quantum Gates
---
In the notebook [qudit_gates_chatgpt](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/ChatGPT-Experiments/blob/main/qudit_gates_chatgpt.ipynb) we created generalized X-gates, Z-gates, Fourier/Hadamard gates, and entangling gates between a qubit and a qutrit, as well as between a qubit and a qudit of arbitrary dimension `n`. Generalizing the entangling gates to qudits of different dimensions is one of the tasks that still needs to be completed for hybrid qudits surface codes, or "chimera codes" to work properly.
